About our work @ Taleemabad:We began our work seven years ago, with a very simple idea: learning’s gotta be fun. You’ve probably experienced this at some point if you’re lucky: you’ve been so engrossed in something that time’s flown by, the day has turned to night, and you’ve had the time of your life. That’s the kind of learning that generates scientists, inventors, and changemakers.And so, seven years ago, we became obsessed with the idea of making all children in Pakistan fall in love with learning. We knew that if we cracked this, we could turn around Pakistan. Our dreamis that a Pakistani kid from the slums/villages will develop the next vaccine, or land on Mars one day.Key Responsibilities:Data Migration: Import our existing data from Hubspot CRM and Quickbooks into the Odoo platform, ensuring data integrity, completeness, and security.Odoo Customization: Customize Odoo modules and functionalities to better align with our internal operations and specific business requirements.Integration Development: Create reliable and secure integrations between Odoo and other tools/platforms we use, ensuring smooth data flow and minimal disruption.Technical Support: Address any technical issues that arise during the migration and post-migration phase, providing solutions in a timely manner.Documentation: Maintain detailed records of all developments and customizations for future reference, and create user guides or documentation as needed.Stay Updated: Regularly update knowledge on the latest Odoo versions, features, and best practices to provide recommendations for potential upgrades or changes.Essential Qualifications:Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, IT, or a related field.Proven experience in Odoo development, with a focus on data migration and system customization.Knowledge of Hubspot CRM and Quickbooks platforms and their data structures.Strong proficiency in Python, PostgreSQL, and XML.Familiarity with Odoo’s ORM, API, and web services.Excellent problem-solving skills and attention to detail.Location & Job Nature:Hybrid in Office F11 / Islamabad.Perks and Benefits Staff LunchEmployee Insurance plan15 casual paid leaves10 medical paid leaves15 grant paid leaves90 paid maternity leaves15 Peternity leaves12 Dragon leavesPersonal enrichment programFlexible schedulesLoan assistanceEmployee recognition and rewardWellness program & personal developmentMedical assistanceEOBI","E-Learning Providers
